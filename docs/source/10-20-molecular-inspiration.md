## Molecular Geometry

Molecular geometry determines several properties of a substance including its
reactivity, polarity, phase of matter, color, magnetism and biological
activity. The position of each atom is determined by the nature of the
chemical bonds by which it is connected to its neighboring atoms. The
molecular geometry can be described by the positions of these atoms in space,
evoking bond lengths of two joined atoms, bond angles of three connected
atoms, and torsion angles (dihedral angles) of three consecutive bonds.
