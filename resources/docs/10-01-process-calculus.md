#  • Process Calculi

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus):

In computer science, the process calculi (or process algebras) are a diverse family of related approaches for formally modelling concurrent systems. Process calculi provide a tool for the high-level description of interactions, communications, and synchronizations between a collection of independent agents or processes. They also provide algebraic laws that allow process descriptions to be manipulated and analyzed, and permit formal reasoning about equivalences between processes.

Leading examples of process calculi include the following:

* [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_Sequential_Processes) (1977; influenced occam, Go, Clojure core.async)
* [CCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_communicating_systems) (1980)
* [ACP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_Communicating_Processes) (1982)
* [LOTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Of_Temporal_Ordering_Specification) (1988)
* [the π-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus) (1992)
* [the join-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-calculus) (1995)
* [PEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEPA) (1996)
