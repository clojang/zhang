# Background

A great deal of the development process surrounding Zhang involved reading,
investigation, prototyping, and sometimes actual research into seemingly quite
disparate topics. Of these, some are still of interest to the curious
developer and, as such, covered in this "Background" section.

Background topics include:

* [The Process Calculus](10-01-process-calculus.html)
* [The Erlang Process Model](10-02-erlang-process-model.html)
* [The Conceptual Components of Erlang's JInterface](10-10-jinterface-concepts.html)
* Motivation for Clojure-native async operations
* Motivation for JVM-based network IO
* A World Virtualized Computation
* Inspiration via Molecular Interactions
* Inspiration via Network Theory
